# CrossFit WOD API

This repository contains the code for the CrossFit WOD API, a RESTful API developed by [berkaykrc](^4^). The API is designed to manage Workouts of the Day (WODs) for a CrossFit training application⁷.

## Project Overview

The CrossFit WOD API is designed following the best practices for building a REST API⁷. It provides an interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting WODs. This helps gym owners come up with workout plans and maintain their workouts inside a single application⁷.

```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```
cd crossfit-wod-api
```

## API Usage

The API endpoints and their usage will be documented in the API documentation, which will be added soon.
