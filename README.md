# CrossFit WOD API

This repository contains the code for the CrossFit WOD API, a RESTful API developed by [berkaykrc](^4^). The API is designed to manage Workouts of the Day (WODs) for a CrossFit training application⁷.

## Project Overview

The CrossFit WOD API is designed following the best practices for building a REST API⁷. It provides an interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting WODs. This helps gym owners come up with workout plans and maintain their workouts inside a single application⁷.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CrossFit WOD API, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/berkaykrc/crossfit-wod-api.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```
cd crossfit-wod-api
```

## API Usage

The API endpoints and their usage will be documented in the API documentation, which will be added soon.

## Contributing

Contributions to the CrossFit WOD API are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and make your changes in a separate branch. Once you have made your changes, you can open a pull request.

## License

The CrossFit WOD API is open source and available under the MIT License.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed following the tutorial on REST API design best practices from [freeCodeCamp](^7^).

Please note that this README is a preliminary version and the project structure, language used, routes, etc., are subject to change as the project evolves. For the most up-to-date information, please refer to the project repository⁴.
